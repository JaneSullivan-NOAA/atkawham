# A WHAM version of the Atka mackerel stock assessment

Current Status: 
- In development
- Bridging the 2022 Atka assessment from amak to wham (growth branch)

## Installing the correct version of WHAM

The `growth` branch on Giancarlo Correa's github 'GiancarloMCorrea/wham' continues to be developed on and is many commits ahead of the the main WHAM repo `timjmiller/wham`. 

```
remotes::install_github(repo = 'GiancarloMCorrea/wham', ref='growth', INSTALL_opts = c("--no-docs", "--no-multiarch", "--no-demo"))
```
